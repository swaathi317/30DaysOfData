# 30DaysOfData
Data is always amazing. If we process them properly, we can obtain great insights. This repository contains my day-to-day activities and learnings of my Data Analysis and Machine Learning Journey.
Before recording my experience, here are the skillsets I already possess with respect to Data Analysis and ML:
- Python and Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Hadoop MapReduce (with both JAVA and Python)
- Working with Spark RDDs and PySpark
- Elastic MapReduce (AWS)

## Day 1

Learning Math behind algorithms is an essential part of learning Machine Learning. 

I started reading Mathematics for Machine Learning book by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong. In order to get a visual representation of the topics, I also watched the Essence of Linear Algebra Essential series by 3Blue1Brown (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). 

As Albert Einstein had quoted, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough", so I have written an article explaining the topics that I have learned today in a simple manner.
