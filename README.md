# 30DaysOfData
Data is always amazing. If we process them properly, we can obtain great insights. This repository contains my day-to-day activities and learnings of my Data Analytics and Machine Learning Journey.
Before recording my experience, here are the skillsets I already possess with respect to Data Analytics and ML:
- Python 
- Hadoop MapReduce (with both JAVA and Python)
- Working with Spark RDDs and PySpark
- Elastic MapReduce (AWS)

## Day 1

Learning Math behind algorithms is an essential part of learning Machine Learning. 

I started reading Mathematics for Machine Learning book by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong. In order to get a visual representation of the topics, I also watched the Essence of Linear Algebra Essential series by 3Blue1Brown (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). 

As Albert Einstein had quoted, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough", so I have written an article explaining the topics that I have learned today in a simple manner. 

Article Link:

Topics covered in the article:
  1. Scalars
  2. Vectors
      * Basis vectors
      * Span of vectors
      * Linear Dependency
  3. Matrix
      * Matrix multiplication
      * Inverse of matrix
      * Matrix Transpose
  4. Inner Products

I also enrolled myself into the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew NG (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I completed the first week's portions today. I also converted my learning notes into an article.

Topics learned today and covered in the article:
1. Univariate Linear Regression
2. Cost/Loss function (with one variable)
3. Gradient Descent (with one variable)


## Day 2

I enrolled in a Introduction to Big Data course(https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-data-introduction) today to learn more about addressing the questions of why we need big data and how a big data strategy is formed. I completed the course and I have also converted my personal notes from the course into a Medium article.

Article Link:
https://swaathi317.medium.com/big-data-an-introduction-b7bc048081c9

Topics covered in the article:
1. Introduction to Big Data
2. Who needs Big data solutions
3. Building a Big Data strategy for organizations
4. Steps in the Data Science process

## Day 3

I learned about Multivariate Linear Regression today and also completed Week-2 of the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew NG (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I have also written an article regarding Multivariate Linear regression in Medium with my understanding. 

Article Link:
https://swaathi317.medium.com/multivariate-linear-regression-1c06b12cb982

Topics covered in the article:
1. Multivariate Linear Regression
2. Gradient Descent for multiple variables
    * How to check if gradient descent is working properly?
    * Feature Scaling 
    * Mean Normalization
    * Features and Polynomial Regression
3. Normal Equation
    * Normal Equation and Non-invertibility
 
 
I also implemented a Univariate Regression Model using the Salary Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/karthickveerakumar/salary-data-simple-linear-regression), in order to predict the salary of employees. 

Implementation Link (contains Dataset and Jupyter Notebook): 
https://github.com/swaathi317/30DaysOfData/tree/main/Univariate%20Linear%20Regression

Topics learned and implemented:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model building (Finding the minimum Coefficient, predicting outcome)
- Evaluation techniques (Mean Square Error, Accuracy)


## Day 4
Today I started reading O'Reilly's Learning Spark by Jules S. Damji, Brooke Wenig, Tathagata Das, and Denny Lee (https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/LearningSpark2.0.pdf). The book covers an in-depth knowledge of Spark concepts and implementation with PySpark. 

Topics learned and implemented on a big data set today:
- Basic Spark concepts: Transformation, Action, Lazy Evaluation
- Spark APIs
- Built-in data sources: Spark SQL tables and views, Spark Dataframes


I also worked on Kaggle problem (https://www.kaggle.com/pavellexyr/one-million-reddit-questions) to analyse a dataset with One Million Kaggle Questions. 

Here is the Kaggle Link:

I have also uploaded the file in kaggle - https://github.com/swaathi317/30DaysOfData/blob/main/DataAnalysis/What%20makes%20a%20good%20reddit%20question.ipynb


## Day 5, Day 6, Day 7, Day 8, Day 9, Day 10
For the past six days, I enrolled myself in DataStax's Apache Cassandra Developer path curriculum courses.
As a part of the DataStax's Developer path curriculum (https://lnkd.in/gb5NX2h6), I completed the below courses.
1. DS101: Introduction to Apache Cassandra
2. DS201: Foundations of Apache Cassandra™ and DataStax Enterprise
3. DS220: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra™ and DataStax Enterprise

These courses are made up of video lessons and hands-on exercises that helped me to implement different use-cases.
It was an exciting journey to learn and implement Cassandra's data modeling for several use-cases. In the relational world, we are always focused on #normalization but designing the database with the respect to the #queries (workflow of the application) has led Cassandra to achieve the highest data access rate of O(1).

I have completed the Apache Cassandra 3 Developer Associate Certification, which is a proctored online exam conducted by DataStax.
