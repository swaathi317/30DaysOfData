# 30DaysOfData
Data is always amazing. If we process them properly, we can obtain great insights. This repository contains my day-to-day activities and learnings of my Data Analytics and Machine Learning Journey.
Before recording my experience, here are the skillsets I already possess with respect to Data Analytics and ML:
- Python 
- Hadoop MapReduce (with both JAVA and Python)
- Working with Spark RDDs and PySpark
- Elastic MapReduce (AWS)

## Day 1

Learning Math behind algorithms is an essential part of learning Machine Learning. 

I started reading Mathematics for Machine Learning book by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong. In order to get a visual representation of the topics, I also watched the Essence of Linear Algebra Essential series by 3Blue1Brown (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). 

As Albert Einstein had quoted, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough", so I have written an article explaining the topics that I have learned today in a simple manner.

Topics covered in the article:
  1. Scalars
  2. Vectors
      * Basis vectors
      * Span of vectors
      * Linear Dependency
  3. Matrix
      * Matrix multiplication
      * Inverse of matrix
      * Matrix Transpose
  4. Inner Products

I also enrolled myself into the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew NG (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I completed the first week's portions today. I also converted my learning notes into an article.
